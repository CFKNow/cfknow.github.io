## Topics

### Description

- **Arithmetic**: basic computations, fractions, decimals, and elementary number theory.
- **Pre-algebra**: introducing algebraic thinking, including basic algebraic operations and principles.
- **Algebra**: covering topics like algebraic expressions, equations, inequalities, functions, and graphing.
- **Geometry**: study of shapes, sizes, properties of space, proofs, and theorems related to angles, circles, triangles, and other figures.
- **Trigonometry**: focusing on the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles, trigonometric functions, and their applications.
- **Precalculus**: preparation for calculus, including advanced algebra, trigonometry, and other topics such as sequences, series, and complex numbers.
- **Calculus**: differential and integral calculus, often split into calculus I (limits, derivatives, applications of derivatives), calculus II (integration, applications of integration), and calculus III (multivariable calculus).
- **Linear algebra**: matrix algebra, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations.
- **Differential equations**: ordinary and partial differential equations and their applications.
- **Discrete mathematics**: combinatorics, graph theory, logic, set theory, and sometimes an introduction to computer science and algorithms.
- **Probability and statistics**: basic probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, statistical inference, and data analysis.
- **Abstract algebra**: the study of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields.
- **Real analysis**: Rigorous study of calculus, continuity, sequences and series of functions, and convergence.
- **Complex analysis**: study of functions that operate on complex numbers.
- **Topology**: properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations.
- **Numerical analysis**: algorithms for numerical approximation of mathematical analysis problems.
- **Mathematical logic**: formal logic, set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory.
- **Mathematical methods**: applied mathematics for engineers and scientists, including special functions, integral transforms, and perturbation methods.
- **Mathematics for education**: methods and content for teaching mathematics at various levels.
- **History of mathematics**: historical development of mathematical concepts and biographies of mathematicians.
- **Mathematical modeling**: the process of creating mathematical representations of real-world situations.
- **Operations research**: optimization, linear programming, queuing theory, and decision-making.
- **Actuarial science**: mathematics of risk, primarily for insurance, finance, and other actuarial applications.
