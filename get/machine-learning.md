Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that equips systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Machine learning involves a variety of algorithms and models that a computer uses to perform a specific task. These models are trained on sets of data, allowing them to make predictions or decisions without being programmed to perform the task. For instance, machine learning models are used to predict which products a customer is likely to purchase, to recognize speech, or to diagnose medical conditions.

The discipline is broadly divided into three categories: supervised learning, where the model is trained on labeled data; unsupervised learning, where the model learns from data without labels, finding the structure within; and reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve some notion of cumulative reward.

Machine learning applications are extensive and growing rapidly, affecting industries from healthcare to finance, and changing the way we interact with technology on a daily basis. It underlies many of the most captivating technological advances, from self-driving cars to personalized medicine and intelligent personal assistants.
