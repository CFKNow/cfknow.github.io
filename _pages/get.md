### Description

- Arithmetic: Basic computations, fractions, decimals, and elementary number theory.
- Pre-Algebra: Introducing algebraic thinking, including basic algebraic operations and principles.
- Algebra: Covering topics like algebraic expressions, equations, inequalities, functions, and graphing.
- Geometry: Study of shapes, sizes, properties of space, proofs, and theorems related to angles, circles, triangles, and other figures.
- Trigonometry: Focusing on the relationships between the sides and angles of triangles, trigonometric functions, and their applications.
- Precalculus: Preparation for calculus, including advanced algebra, trigonometry, and other topics such as sequences, series, and complex numbers.
- Calculus: Differential and integral calculus, often split into Calculus I (limits, derivatives, applications of derivatives), Calculus II (integration, applications of integration), and Calculus III (multivariable calculus).
- Linear Algebra: Matrix algebra, vector spaces, linear transformations, and systems of linear equations.
- Differential Equations: Ordinary and partial differential equations and their applications.
- Discrete Mathematics: Combinatorics, graph theory, logic, set theory, and sometimes an introduction to computer science and algorithms.
- Probability and Statistics: Basic probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, statistical inference, and data analysis.
- Abstract Algebra: The study of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields.
- Real Analysis: Rigorous study of calculus, continuity, sequences and series of functions, and convergence.
- Complex Analysis: Study of functions that operate on complex numbers.
- Topology: Properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations.
- Numerical Analysis: Algorithms for numerical approximation of mathematical analysis problems.
- Mathematical Logic: Formal logic, set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory.
