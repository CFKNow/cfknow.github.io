- Differential equations: ordinary and partial differential equations and their applications.
- Discrete mathematics: combinatorics, graph theory, logic, set theory, and sometimes an introduction to computer science and algorithms.
- Probability and statistics: basic probability theory, random variables, probability distributions, statistical inference, and data analysis.
- Abstract algebra: the study of algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields.
- Real analysis: Rigorous study of calculus, continuity, sequences and series of functions, and convergence.
- Complex analysis: study of functions that operate on complex numbers.
- Topology: properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations.
- Numerical analysis: algorithms for numerical approximation of mathematical analysis problems.
- Mathematical logic: formal logic, set theory, model theory, recursion theory, and proof theory.
